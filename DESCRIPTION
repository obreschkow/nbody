Title: N-body simulation for R
Version: 1.02
Author: Danail Obreschkow
Maintainer: Danail Obreschkow <danail.obreschkow@icrar.org>
Description: This package contains tools to run simple direct gravitational N-body simulations. It uses a variable block timestep and lets the user choose between a range of integrators, including 4th and 6th order integrators for high-accuracy simulations. Basic top-hat smoothing is available as an option. The code also allows the definition of background particles that are fixed or in uniform motion, not subject to acceleration by other particles.
